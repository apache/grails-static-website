    title: 'How can I contribute to Grails code?'
    answer: '<p>If you are looking to make an initial contribution, just raise your hand on the [Apache Grails Developer mailing-lists](https://grails.apache.org/community.html) and tell us about your desire to work on a particular problem.</p><p>For more complicated tasks, the best approach is to bring your interest to the attention of the Grails developers. They can provide guidance on how best to tackle a particular problem, collaborate on implementation ideas, and discuss the semantics or scope of the proposed change.</p><h3>Cloning the code base</h3><p>To work on the Grails code base, you should be proficient in <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and (ideally) have an account on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, so you can create <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull requests</a> with your changes.</p><p>If you have Git installed on your machine, you should be able to clone the Grails repository with the following command:</p><pre><code>git clone git://github.com/apache/grails-core.git</code></pre><p>Make sure you configure Git appropriately with the same email that you registered with on GitHub.</p><pre><code>git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"<br/>git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre><p>You can verify these are configured appropriately by running:</p><pre><code>git config --list</code></pre><h3>Working on the code base</h3><p>If you are working with the IntelliJ IDEA development environment, you can import the project using the Intellij Gradle Tooling ( "File / Import Project" and select the "build.gradle" file).</p><p>To get a local development version of Grails working, first run the install task.</p><pre><code>./gradlew assemble<br/>./gradlew publishToMavenLocal</code></pre><p>Then install <a href="https://sdkman.io">SDKman</a>, which is the quickest way to set up a development environment.</p><p>Once you have SDKman installed, point SDKman to your local development version of Grails.</p><pre><code>sdk install grails dev /path/to/checkout<br/>sdk use grails dev</code></pre><p>Now the "grails" command will be using your development version!</p><p>The most important command you will have to run before sending your changes is the test command.</p><pre><code>./gradlew test</code></pre><p>For a successful contribution, all tests should be green!</p><h3>Creating a pull request</h3><p>Once you are satisfied with your changes:</p><ul><li>commit your changes in your local branch</li><li>push your changes to your remote branch on GitHub</li><li>send us a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull request</a></li></ul>'
