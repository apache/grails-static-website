                                The Apache Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> Community is committed to the continued innovation, development, maintenance, and support of the Grails framework.

                        <p>
                            Our goal is to provide Grails framework users the support they need while maintaining as much focus as possible on innovation.

                        <p>
                            Versions of the Grails framework may fall into one of three lifecycle stages:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Active Development</li>
                            <li>Active Maintenance</li>
                            <li>End of Support</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3 class="subsection-header">Active Development</h3>
                        <p>
                            Grails versions that are in “Active Development” receive regular updates, including new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes. These versions receive a majority of our time and effort investment and represent the latest and greatest that the Grails framework has to offer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We recommend that new and existing Grails applications be built with or upgraded to these versions.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3 class="subsection-header">Active Maintenance</h3>
                        <p>
                            "Active Maintenance" releases receive limited bug fixes and patches, mostly focused around the resolution of critical security advisories. New features, performance improvements, and minor bug fixes are unlikely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We recommend that organizations whose Grails applications depend on a release that's in Active Maintenance upgrade to the latest “Active Development” version in order to make use of the latest features the framework has to offer.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3 class="subsection-header">End of Support</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once a Grails framework version moves from "Active Maintenance" to "End of Support", it is unlikely to receive additional updates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We recommend that organizations which are relying on an End of Support version of the Grails framework upgrade to a "Active Maintenance" or "Active Development" version as soon as possible.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h3 class="subsection-header">Commercial Support</h3>
                        <p>Please note that the Apache Software Foundation does not offer commercial support for Apache Grails or related applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We understand that there are situations in which it may be difficult to keep an application up to date with the latest supported versions of the Grails framework. For these situations, <a href="support.html">commercial support options</a> can help address critical security advisories for the version of the Grails framework that you are utilizing.
