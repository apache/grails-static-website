							<strong>
								The Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> Foundation is committed to the continued innovation, development, maintenance, and support of the Grails framework.
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Our goal is to provide Grails framework users with the support they need while maintaining as much focus as possible on innovation.  The level and type of support available for earlier versions of the Grails framework will change as the framework continues to evolve forward.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3 class="subsection-header">Active Development</h3>
						<p>
							Grails framework versions that are in “Active Development” receive regular updates including bug fixes, performance enhancements, and bug fixes.  These versions receive a majority of our time and effort investment and represent the latest and greatest that the Grails framework has to offer.  We suggest that new and existing Grails framework applications be built from or upgraded to these versions.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3 class="subsection-header">Maintenance Support</h3>
						<p>
							Grails framework releases that are within their “Maintenance Support” window will receive limited bug fixes and patches mostly focused around the resolution of critical security advisories.  New features, performance improvements, or minor bug fixes are unlikely.  We suggest that Grails framework applications which depend on a release that is in Maintenance Support to upgrade to the latest “Active Development” version in order to make use of the latest features that the Grails framework has to offer.  Once the Maintenance Support window for a version of the Grails framework closes, it will not likely receive additional updates.
