                            The Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> Foundation is committed to the continued innovation, development, maintenance, and support of the Grails framework.  Our goal is to provide Grails framework users the support they need while maintaining as much focus as possible on innovation. The level and type of support available for earlier versions of the Grails framework will change as the framework continues to evolve.
