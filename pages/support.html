            The GrailsÂ® Foundation is committed to the continued evolution, development, maintenance, and support of the Grails framework. Our goal is to provide Grails users the support they need while maintaining as much focus as possible on innovation. The level and type of support available for earlier versions of the Grails framework will change as the Framework continues to evolve, and the support team remains available to help regardless of the version of the Grails framework that you are using.  For more information about the level of support available for each version of the Grails framework, please see our <a href="support-schedule.html">support schedule</a>.

            As the Grails framework grows and evolves, it also changes.  Some of these changes may not be compatible with older versions of the framework.  While the updates may be more ideal for the future, it may also make it more difficult for organizations to easily upgrade their Grails framework applications to the latest version.  For this reason, we are proud to offer premium product support for many versions of the Grails framework, including versions that have reached the end of public support.  For more information about premium support options for your Grails framework applications, please see our <a href="support-schedule.html">support schedule</a>.
