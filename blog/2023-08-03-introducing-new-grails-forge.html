<p><span class="author">By Puneet Behl</span></p>
<p><span class="date">August 3, 2023</span></p>
<p>Dear Grails Developers,</p>
<p>The Grails Foundation™ is thrilled to unveil the next level of Grails application generation - the New Grails Forge! Building upon the foundation of the previous Grails Forge, we have introduced a brand new implementation of the Grails Forge website, and the Grails Command Line Interface (CLI).</p>
<h2>Multiple Application Types for Your Needs</h2>
<p>The New Grails Forge also introduces Grails Profiles through application-types, supporting various application types to meet your specific needs. Currently, we offer support for Web, REST API, Web Plugin, and Plugin. Stay tuned as we plan to add support for additional application types, including REST API Plugin, React, and Angular.</p>
<h2>The New Grails Forge CLI: Speed, Flexibility, and Efficiency</h2>
<p>Before we delve into the Grails Forge UI, let's first highlight the power of the New Grails Forge CLI. Inspired by the efficiency and flexibility of the Micronaut framework's CLI, the New Grails Forge CLI offers a lightning-fast and easy-to-maintain approach to creating and managing Grails projects.</p>
<p>With the New Grails Forge CLI, you can create Grails applications offline or in areas with limited connectivity, making it a perfect choice for developers on the go. Powered by the Picocli library, the CLI delivers exceptional performance and robustness, ensuring a smooth and seamless command-line experience.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with the Grails Forge UI</h2>
<p>Getting started with the Grails Forge UI is as simple as 1, 2, 3:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Visit the Website: Head over to the official Grails Forge UI website at <a href="https://start.grails.org">https://start.grails.org</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore and Customize: Take a tour of the website and explore its features. Customize your project settings to match your development requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate Your Project: Once you're satisfied with your choices, hit the &quot;Generate Project&quot; button. Your Grails project will be created instantly, and you can download the project files to get started immediately.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Global CLI Compatibility: The Best of Both Worlds</h2>
<p>While many commands transition smoothly to Gradle tasks, we understand that some actions require the familiarity of the globally-installed Grails CLI. Fear not, as the New Grails Forge thoughtfully addresses this concern. If you have the Grails CLI installed on your system, you can still use it within your project folder for commands involving file manipulations. This harmonious integration ensures a seamless transition for existing projects while taking advantage of the new features of the New Grails Forge.</p>
<h2>Extending Functionality: A World of Possibilities</h2>
<p>The New Grails Forge empowers you to extend the functionality of your projects effortlessly. Although some plugin-specific commands may require slight adjustments during the migration, we've got you covered with our comprehensive Grails Documentation, providing valuable insights into creating custom commands. This newfound capability allows you to tailor commands to your unique needs, automate tasks, integrate with third-party tools, and streamline repetitive processes.</p>
<h2>Lightning-Fast and Offline Ready</h2>
<p>With the new CLI, you can create Grails applications even offline or in areas with limited connectivity, thanks to its lightning-fast performance. Say goodbye to frustrating delays and embrace a seamless and efficient application generation process.</p>
<h2>Powered by Picocli and Rocker Template Engine</h2>
<p>To achieve such speed and efficiency, we harnessed the power of the Picocli library to build a robust and flexible command-line application. This integration ensures that you have a user-friendly and highly maintainable CLI at your fingertips.</p>
<p>Moreover, we adopted the Rocker template engine, which produces statically typed plain Java objects, guaranteeing precision and performance in every command you execute.</p>
<h2>Saying Farewell to the Grails CLI Wrapper</h2>
<p>With Grails 6, we're embracing a new era where the Grails CLI wrapper will no longer be included in new projects. Instead, we encourage you to leverage the Gradle build system for greater flexibility and a more cohesive development environment. Common commands, such as &quot;./grailsw run-app,&quot; can now be executed directly using the straightforward &quot;./gradlew bootRun.&quot;</p>
<h2>Enhanced Plugin Compatibility with Grails ApplicationCommand</h2>
<p>While many commands transition seamlessly to Gradle tasks, we acknowledge that certain commands, supported via plugins, may require special attention during migration. To address this, we introduced Grails ApplicationCommand tasks, enabling compatibility with plugin-specific commands. Refer to our comprehensive Grails Documentation for valuable insights on creating custom commands and making the most of this new capability.</p>
<h2>Turbocharge Your Grails Development: Swift Installation of the New Grails Forge</h2>
<p>Installing the New Grails Forge is a breeze! Follow these step-by-step instructions based on your preferred method:</p>

<h3>Option 2: Download &amp; Install Binary</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the latest binary from the following link, based on your Operating System: <a href="https://github.com/grails/grails-forge/releases">New Grails CLI Binary</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract the downloaded zip file to an appropriate directory on your system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an environment variable named &quot;GRAILS_HOME&quot; and set its value to the installation directory, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows: <code>set GRAILS_HOME=c:/grails</code></li>
<li>On macOS/Linux: <code>export GRAILS_HOME=/usr/local/grails</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update the PATH environment variable to include the Grails binary directory. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows: <code>set PATH=%PATH%;%GRAILS_HOME%\bin</code></li>
<li>On macOS/Linux: <code>export PATH=$PATH:$GRAILS_HOME/bin</code></li>
</ul>
