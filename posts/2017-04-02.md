## Introduction

When you build and run Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> 3 applications, often you may want to know about the build environment via the running application.

Since the early days of the Grails framework, we were able to add arbitrary properties to the `application.properties` file. The Grails framework provides this information through the `grails.util.Metadata` class, and for views this is easily made available through the tag.

Since Grails 3 is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), the old `application.properties` is no longer in use. Instead we'll add properties to `grails.build.info`

## The Basics

When you build/run your Grails applications, one of tasks that Gradle always executes is `buildProperties`. This task takes a small set of build information from your project and places it in a file, which the Grails `Metadata` class later reads. This file is located in `META-INF` and is named `grails.build.info`.

At build time, you can find this file at `build/resources/main/META-INF/grails.build.info`. The contents of this file looks like:

```property
#Thu, 02 Feb 2017 15:30:37 +0100

info.app.version=0.1
info.app.name=metadata
grails.env=production
info.app.grailsVersion=3.2.5
```

This info primarily comes from `build.gradle` and `gradle.properties` (the curious can check out the source code in [grails-core](https://github.com/apache/grails-core/blob/6c85ec239aa8cc4a9f646bb345c70c327ddb2dbc/grails-gradle-plugin/src/main/groovy/org/grails/gradle/plugin/core/GrailsGradlePlugin.groovy#L179)). This file will be part of your final application when you build your `.jar` or `.war` file.

In a `.gsp`, this information is available by using the meta tag like this: (see the [tag](https://gsp.grails.org/latest/guide/index.html#tags) documentation).

## Adding More Information to `grails.build.info`

With the Gradle build system, it is possible to hook into the build process and execute our own code. In this case we want Gradle to complete writing `grails.build.info`, and then we want to add additional properties to the file.

To accomplish this, add the following snippet to `build.gradle` in your project:

```groovy
buildProperties.doLast {
    // Find the right file
    File grailsBuildInfoFile = it.outputs.files.files.find { it.name == 'grails.build.info' }
    if(!grailsBuildInfoFile) return // No need to continue if the file is not there
    Properties properties = new Properties()
    // Read properties from the file
    grailsBuildInfoFile.withInputStream {
        properties.load(it)
    }
    // Add new properties from various sources
    properties.setProperty('build.time', new Date().format("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"))
    // Get a System property
    properties.setProperty('build.java.version', System.getProperty('java.version'))
    // Get the host name where the build was created
    properties.setProperty('build.host', InetAddress.localHost.hostName)
    // Add property set by your CI (in this case Bamboo)
    Map<String, String> env = System.getenv()
    if(env.bamboo_buildNumber) {
        properties.setProperty('build.number', env.bamboo_buildNumber)
        properties.setProperty('build.git.revision', env.bamboo_planRepository_revision)
        properties.setProperty('build.git.branch', env.bamboo_planRepository_branch)
    }
    // Write the properties back to the file
    grailsBuildInfoFile.withOutputStream {
        properties.store(it,null)
    }
}
```

This example shows:

*   How to set `build.time` from the time that the build was executed
*   How to set values from `System.properties`
*   How to get your build host name
*   How to read environment variables set by your build server (in the above example by [Atlassian Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo))

Now that we have this build information captured in `grails.build.info`, we can show it in our application in a `.gsp` page.

For example:

```html
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Build time</td><td><g:meta name="build.time"></g:meta>></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Build java version</td><td><g:meta name="build.java.version"></g:meta>></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Build host</td><td><g:meta name="build.host"></g:meta>></td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

... and so on.

> NOTE: If you use the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, you can write [your own custom InfoContributor](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-application-info-custom) that uses Grails `Metadata`!
>
> Alternatively, you can leverage the [Auto-configured InfoContributors](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-application-info-autoconfigure) to:
> - [add git commit info](https://guides.grails.org/adding-commit-info/guide/index.html)
> -expose build info by copying `grails.build.info` to a `build-info.properties` file ([BuildInfoContributor](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v1.5.2.RELEASE/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/info/BuildInfoContributor.java))
> - expose environment info by configuring properties starting with `'info.'` such as `'info.app.name'` ([EnvironmentInfoContributor](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v1.5.2.RELEASE/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/info/EnvironmentInfoContributor.java))

## Conclusion

This blog-post shows how you can easily add build information to your Grails 3 application by leveraging the tasks already available within the Gradle build, and how you can show them in your application.
