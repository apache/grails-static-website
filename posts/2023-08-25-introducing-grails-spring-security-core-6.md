**Exciting News from the Grails Foundation: Unveiling Grails Spring Security Core Plugin 6.0.0**

Greetings, fellow developers! Prepare to be amazed by the latest release – Grails Spring Security Core Plugin 6.0.0! This isn't just an upgrade in security; it's a journey towards greater heights for your applications. Packed with updates and improvements, this release doesn't just enhance security; it also streamlines your development experience. Let's explore the exciting changes this release brings.

## Seamless Grails 6 Compatibility with Upgraded Commands

One of the most remarkable enhancements is the seamless transition to Grails 6. Grails Spring Security Core Plugin 6.0.0 now boasts upgraded commands fully compatible with Grails 6. This is crucial because the old scripts you might have been using would have caused compatibility issues with Grails 6. But worry not! We've revamped these commands, ensuring a smooth transition and allowing you to continue using them seamlessly.

Do you remember running a script like `s2-quickstart` using the command:

```bash
grails s2-quickstart com.yourapp User Role
```

This command was used to create user and role classes (and optionally a requestmap class) in your specified package.

Fast forward to Grails 6, things have evolved. Now, you can trigger these commands using Gradle tasks, like so:

```bash
./gradlew runCommand "-Pargs=s2-quickstart com.yourapp User Role"
```

The `runCommand` Gradle task allows you to execute various Grails ApplicationCommands, just like the good old `s2-quickstart`. The difference? It's sleeker, perfectly aligned with Grails 6, and propels your app into modern development.

## Spring Security Leveled Up to 5.8.6

Security is paramount, and that's why we've given the underlying Spring Security framework a power boost in Grails Spring Security Core Plugin. It's now fueled by version 5.8.6. This ensures that your application benefits from the latest security enhancements and bug fixes from the Spring Security team. By staying up to date with Spring Security versions, your app is fortified against emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

## Navigating Docs Made Effortless

We've heard your feedback – navigating documentation shouldn't be a chore. That's why we've spruced up the Internal Docs task. This magic generates documentation that empowers you to grasp the plugin's features and their effective usage. But there's more – we've added a slick select drop-down feature. This nifty addition enables you to switch effortlessly between documentation for different releases. Whether diving into the latest version or revisiting an older one, finding the info you need is now seamless.

## Getting Cozy with Dependency Updates
