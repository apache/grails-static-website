## Limitations of the Previous Plugin Portal

Before we dive further into the awesomeness of the new portal, let's address the shortcomings of the previous version. It had some issues that weren't exactly developer-friendly:

1. **Frequent Downtime**: The old portal was notorious for going offline quite often, causing disruptions and frustration for developers.

2. **High Resource Utilization**: It was a resource-hungry beast, slowing down performance due to its dynamic architecture.

3. **Slow Performance**: Slow loading times and delays were common complaints. The dynamic setup struggled with the increasing plugin data, resulting in sluggishness.

## All Plugins in One Place

Did you know that all the plugins on the Grails Plugin Portal are sourced from [https://github.com/grails/grails-plugins-metadata/tree/grails-plugins.json](https://github.com/grails/grails-plugins-metadata/tree/grails-plugins.json)? We've streamlined the process to ensure you have access to the most up-to-date plugins directly from the source.

## How to Include or Update Your Grails Plugin

Excited to get your Grails plugin into the spotlight on our portal? Here's how you can include or update your Grails plugin:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the [Grails Plugin Metadata Repository](https://github.com/grails/grails-plugins-metadata).

2. **Edit the JSON File**: Navigate to the `grails-plugins.json` file in your forked repository. This file contains the plugin metadata.

3. **Add Your Plugin**: To include your plugin, simply add its metadata to the JSON file. Make sure to follow the established format.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've added or updated your plugin details, submit a pull request to the original [Grails Plugin Metadata Repository](https://github.com/grails/grails-plugins-metadata). Our team will review it and, upon approval, your plugin will be part of the portal!
