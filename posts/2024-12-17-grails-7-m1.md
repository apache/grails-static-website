The Grails Foundation is excited for the release of Grails Framework 7.0.0-M1! We encourage you to try this release and provide your feedback [here](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues).

## What's Changed

- New Java 17 Baseline

- New [Jakarata](https://jakarta.ee/) Baseline replaces the legacy `javax.*` package scope.

- Micronaut as a parent context is removed.  Use [Micronuat for Spring](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-spring/latest/guide/) to add Micronaut support to your application.

- New Gradle 8 Baseline

- New Groovy 4.0.24 Baseline

### With the release of Grails 7.0.0-M1, we have:
* Introduced support for the latest released version of Java (23).
* Changed the default styling to use Bootstrap 5.3.3. Both [Scaffolding](https://github.com/grails/scaffolding) & [Fields](https://github.com/gpc/fields) now support bootstrap classes.
* Reduced deployment sizes.
* Switched to a Grails BOM (`grails-bom`) that extends the Spring BOM (`spring-bom`) for simplified dependency management. Versions no longer need declared for any library in the bom.  Grails gradle plugins will apply the BOM by default - if using `buildSrc` be sure to apply it.
* Removed the `-plain` suffix from Grails Plugin jars.
* When the `org.grails.grails-plugin` gradle plugin is applied, the `bootJar` task is now disabled by default.  
* Created a new tag `g:formActionSubmit` to support submitting to different actions.  `g:actionSubmit` will be removed in a future release.
* Added containerized browser testing using [Testcontainers](https://java.testcontainers.org/) via the the [Geb Grails Plugin](https://github.com/grails/geb) - web browser version synchronization issues are no longer a problem! 
* Added a new annotation `@Scaffold` for use on Controllers & Services to eliminate common boilerplate in the [Scaffolding Plugin](https://github.com/grails/scaffolding).
* Fixed several issues related to Controller namespace support.
* Started to discontinue bean overriding in the core framework by adopting standard [Spring Auto-configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/auto-configuration.html).
* Enhanced `g:form` to provide CSRF protection when Spring Security CSRF is enabled.
* Decoupled a significant amount of dependencies in Grails that should allow easier maintenance going forward.
* Upgraded external dependencies to the latest possible versions. 
* Removed Sitemesh 2 coupling. Sitemesh 3 is the default version used.

These updates will enhance the stability and reliability of the framework.

## Dependency Upgrades

Keeping up with the latest dependencies is crucial for the health of any framework. In this release, we have upgraded various dependencies to their latest versions, including but not limited to the following:

- Spring Boot 3.4.1
- Spring Core 6.2.1
- Slf4j 2.0.16
- Jakarta 6.0.0
- H2 2.3.232
- JUnit 5.11.4
- Asset Pipeline 5.0.5

## Installing Grails 7.0.0-M1

You can get started with Grails 7.0.0-M1 today by visiting our [official website](https://start.grails.org/). Alternatively, you can quickly install Grails 7.0.0-M1 using the [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/).

1. If you don't have SDKMan installed, follow the instructions at [SDKMan Installation Guide](https://sdkman.io/install/) to set it up.

2. Once SDKMan is installed, open your terminal and run the following command to install Grails 7.0.0-M1:

    ````shell
    sdk install grails 7.0.0-M1
    ````

3. You're all set! To verify the installation, run:

    ````shell
    grails --version
    ````

## Upgrading Your Existing Applications to Grails 7.0.0-M1

If you already have a Grails application and want to upgrade to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (preferably JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Update your application's `gradle.propreties` file to specify Grails 7.0.0-M1 as the desired version.

    ````properties
    grailsVersion=7.0.0-M1
    grailsGradlePluginVersion=7.0.0-M3
    ````

3. Make any necessary adjustments to your application code, configuration, and dependencies to ensure compatibility with the new version.  See https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/single.html#upgrading60x

Normally, Grails Core dependencies are automatically updated using the Grails Bill of Materials (BOM). However, if you have specific versions defined in your build configuration, you may need to manually update them to align with Grails 7.0.0-M1.

By following these steps, you can smoothly transition your existing Grails application to the exciting Grails 7.0.0-M1.

### Exploring Alternative Approaches

If manual dependency updates seem daunting, or you want a more streamlined approach, consider the following alternatives:

#### 1. Use Grails Forge Website

Visit [https://start.grails.org](https://start.grails.org) and generate a new Grails application with Grails 7.0.0-M1. Compare the versions in the newly generated application with your existing one to identify any discrepancies. This can serve as a reference point for your update.

#### 2. Automated Dependency Update Bots

Configure automated dependency update bots like [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) or [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) with your source control platform (e.g., GitHub). These bots can automatically detect and update outdated dependencies in your project, including Grails dependencies, saving you time and effort in manual updates.

With these steps and alternative approaches, you should be well on your way to enjoying the exciting features and improvements in Grails 7.0.0-M1. Happy coding!
