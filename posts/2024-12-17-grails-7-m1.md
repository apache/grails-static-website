The Grails Foundation is excited for the release of Grails Framework 7.0.0-M1.\
We encourage you to try this pre-release and provide your feedback [here](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues).

## What's Changed
* New minimum versions introduced:
  * Gradle 8
  * Groovy 4
  * Java 17
  * Sitemesh 3
  * Spring Boot 3 (Spring Framework 6)
* Default integration of the Micronaut Framework has been removed from Grails. Use [Micronaut for Spring](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-spring/latest/guide/) to add Micronaut support to your Grails application.

### With the release of Grails 7.0.0-M1, we have:
* Added support for:
  * Gradle 8
  * Groovy 4
  * Java 23 (runtime support)
  * Sitemesh 3
  * Spring Boot 3, including transition from `javax` to `jakarta` namespace.
* Updated the default styling to use Bootstrap 5.3.3. Both [Scaffolding](https://github.com/grails/scaffolding) and [Fields](https://github.com/gpc/fields) now support Bootstrap classes.
* Reduced deployment sizes (currently pending, due to an issue with `asset-pipeline`).
* Enhanced the [Grails BOM](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.grails/grails-bom) by adding more versions and extending the [Spring Boot BOM](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-dependencies) for streamlined dependency management. Grails Gradle Plugins apply the BOM by default. If using `buildSrc`, ensure it is manually applied.
* Removed the `-plain` suffix from the JAR artifact output in Grails Plugin projects.
* Disabled all artifact outputs except the JAR artifact for the `assemble` task in Grails Plugin projects.
* Introduced a new tag, `g:formActionSubmit`, to support submitting forms to different actions. The `g:actionSubmit` tag is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
* Added support for containerized browser testing using [Testcontainers](https://java.testcontainers.org/) through the [Geb Grails Plugin](https://github.com/grails/geb), eliminating web browser version synchronization issues. 
* Introduced a new annotation, `@Scaffold`, for Controllers and Services to eliminate common boilerplate in the [Scaffolding Plugin](https://github.com/grails/scaffolding).
* Resolved multiple issues related to Controller namespace support.
* Begun the process of discontinuing bean overriding in the core framework by adopting standard [Spring Auto-configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/auto-configuration.html).
* Enhanced the `g:form` tag to include CSRF protection when Spring Security CSRF is enabled.
* Decoupled a significant amount of dependencies in Grails, enabling easier maintenance moving forward.
* Upgraded external dependencies to the latest available versions.
* Removed tight coupling with Sitemesh. Sitemesh 3 is now the default version.
* Brought back the `grails-shell` and `grails-profiles` that was removed in Grails 6.

## Dependency Upgrades

## Installing Grails 7.0.0-M1
Try out Grails 7.0.0-M1 today by visiting the online app creator - [Grails Forge](https://start.grails.org/).
Alternatively, you can quickly install Grails 7.0.0-M1 using the [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/).

1. If you don't have SDKMan installed, follow the instructions at [SDKMan Installation Guide](https://sdkman.io/install/) to set it up.
2. Once SDKMan is installed, open your terminal and run the following command to install Grails 7.0.0-M1:

    ```shell
    sdk install grails 7.0.0-M1
    ```

3. You're all set! To verify the installation, run:

    ```shell
    grails --version
    ```

## Upgrading Your Existing Applications to Grails 7.0.0-M1

If you already have a Grails application and want to upgrade to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (preferably JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Update your application's `gradle.properties` file to specify Grails 7.0.0-M1 as the desired version.

    ```properties
    grailsVersion=7.0.0-M1
    grailsGradlePluginVersion=7.0.0-M3
    ```

3. Make any necessary adjustments to your application code, configuration, and dependencies to ensure compatibility with the new version. See https://docs.grails.org/7.0.0-M1/guide/single.html#upgrading60x.

Normally, Grails Core dependencies are automatically updated using the Grails Bill of Materials (BOM). However, if you have specific versions defined in your build configuration, you may need to manually update them to align with Grails 7.0.0-M1.

By following these steps, you can smoothly transition your existing Grails application to the exciting Grails 7.0.0-M1.

### Exploring Alternative Approaches

If manual dependency updates seem daunting, or you want a more streamlined approach, consider the following alternatives:

#### 1. Use Grails Forge Website

Visit [Grails Forge](https://start.grails.org) and generate a new Grails application with Grails 7.0.0-M1. Compare the versions in the newly generated application with your existing one to identify any discrepancies. This can serve as a reference point for your update.

#### 2. Automated Dependency Update Bots

Configure automated dependency update bots like [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) or [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) with your source control platform (e.g., GitHub). These bots can automatically detect and update outdated dependencies in your project, including Grails dependencies, saving you time and effort in manual updates.

With these steps and alternative approaches, you should be well on your way to enjoying the exciting features and improvements in Grails 7.0.0-M1. Happy coding!
