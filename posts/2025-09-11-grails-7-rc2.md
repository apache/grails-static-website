## Additional Releases

The following plugins and tools are being released alongside Grails 7.0.0-RC2:

### Grails Spring Security 7.0.0-RC2

See the release page: [https://github.com/apache/grails-spring-security/releases/tag/v7.0.0-RC2](https://github.com/apache/grails-spring-security/releases/tag/v7.0.0-RC2)

### Grails Quartz 4.0.0-RC2

See the release page: [https://github.com/apache/grails-quartz/releases/tag/v4.0.0-RC2](https://github.com/apache/grails-quartz/releases/tag/v4.0.0-RC2)

### Grails Redis 5.0.0-RC2

See the release page: [https://github.com/apache/grails-redis/releases/tag/v5.0.0-RC2](https://github.com/apache/grails-redis/releases/tag/v5.0.0-RC2)

### Grails GitHub Actions 1.0.0

See the release page: [https://github.com/apache/grails-github-actions/releases/tag/v1.0.0](https://github.com/apache/grails-github-actions/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

* Initial release of actions for Gradle projects' release workflows.

**Purpose**  
The actions being released are used in gradle projects for their release workflows to handle automated version management & documentation publishing.

**Actions**
* deploy-github-pages action - a GitHub Action to copy documentation files to a specified documentation branch. Works by creating a subfolder named the same as the documentation branch, checking out the documentation branch to that folder, staging files, and then pushing them. Action is configured via environment variables.
* export-gradle-properties action - a GitHub Action that takes a Java properties file (typically gradle.properties) and exports each property as an environment variable for use in subsequent steps of your workflow.
* post-release action - a GitHub Action that handles steps necessary to close out a GitHub Release process. Including incrementing the next version & merging back to the target branch
* pre-release - a GitHub action that handles any pre-release steps as part of a GitHub release process. Including the project version being set based on the specified GitHub tag and updating the associated tag to the release.

### Grails Gradle Publish 0.0.1

See the release page: [https://github.com/apache/incubator-grails-gradle-publish/releases/tag/v0.0.1](https://github.com/apache/incubator-grails-gradle-publish/releases/tag/v0.0.1)

## Dependency Upgrades
In this release, we've upgraded several dependency versions, including but not limited to the following:

* Asset Pipeline 5.0.16 (now cloud.wondrify.asset-pipeline)
* Groovy 4.0.28
* Spring Framework 6.2.10
* Spring Boot 3.5.5
* Gradle 8.14.3
* See all in the [grails-bom](https://docs.grails.org/[%version]/ref/Versions/Grails%20BOM.html).

## Generating a new Grails [%version] application with Grails Forge
Try out Grails today by visiting our online application generator [Grails Forge](https://start.grails.org). This is the quickest and the recommended way to get started with Grails.

After installing JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 or later and the [Grails Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18504-grails), the Grails Application Forge will also be available under New Project in IntelliJ IDEA. 

Within your newly generated project you can access the Grails CLIs with the Grails Wrapper.

See the [Types of CLI](https://docs.grails.org/[%version]/guide/gettingStarted.html#_types_of_command_line_interface_cli) section in the documentation for details on each CLI.

grail-shell-cli

```shell
grailsw
```

grails-forge-cli

```shell
grailsw -t forge
```

## Installing Grails CLIs [%version] with SDKMan
Alternatively, you can quickly install Grails [%version] CLIs (grails-shell-cli and grails-forge-cli) using [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io).

See the [Types of CLI](https://docs.grails.org/[%version]/guide/gettingStarted.html#_types_of_command_line_interface_cli) section in the documentation for details on each CLI.

1. If you don't have SDKMan installed, follow the instructions at [SDKMan Installation Guide](https://sdkman.io/install) to set it up.
2. Once SDKMan is installed, open your terminal and run the following command to install Grails [%version]:

    ```shell
    sdk install grails [%version]
    ```

3. You're all set! To verify the installation, run:

    ```shell
    grails --version
    ```

The Grails Shell CLI can be accessed as:

```shell
grails
``` 
or
```shell
grails-shell-cli
```
The Grails Forge CLI can be accessed as:
```shell
grails -t forge
```
or
```shell
grails-forge-cli
```    

## Upgrading Your Existing Applications to Grails [%version]
If you already have a Grails application and want to upgrade to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (preferably JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 or later).
2. Update your application's `gradle.properties` file to specify Grails [%version] as the desired version.

    ```properties
    grailsVersion=[%version]
    ```

3. Make any necessary adjustments to your application code, configuration, and dependencies to ensure compatibility with
   the new version. [See Upgrade Guide](https://docs.grails.org/[%version]/guide/upgrading.html#upgrading60x)

Normally, Grails Core dependencies are automatically updated using the Grails Bill of Materials (BOM). However, if you
have specific versions defined in your build configuration, you may need to manually update them to align with
Grails [%version].

By following these steps, you should be able to transition your existing Grails application to Grails [%version].

### Exploring Alternative Approaches
If manual dependency updates seem daunting, or you want a more streamlined approach, consider the following alternatives:

#### 1. Use Grails Forge Website
Visit [Grails Forge](https://start.grails.org) and generate a new Grails application with Grails [%version]. Compare the
versions in the newly generated application with your existing one to identify any discrepancies. This can serve as a
reference point for your update.

#### 2. Automated Dependency Update Bots
Configure automated dependency update bots like [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com) or
[Dependabot](https://dependabot.com) with your source control platform (e.g., GitHub). These bots can automatically
detect and update outdated dependencies in your project, including Grails dependencies, saving you time and effort in
manual updates.

With these steps and alternative approaches, you should be well on your way to enjoying the exciting features and
improvements in Grails [%version].

## Why should you try out Grails [%version]?
* Help us test this major upgrade of the Grails Framework and provide feedback.
* Be ready for when Grails 7 is released.

## Grails 7 Release Schedule
* We will continue to work on [updating and fixing issues](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/487/views/2) over the next few
  weeks.
* Based on feedback, an Apache Grails RC or Final release is targeted for September 2025.
