## What's Changed
For changes made in Grails 7 prior to 7.0.0-M4, check out the [Grails 7.0.0-M1 Release Blog Post](/blog/2024-12-23-grails-7-m1.html) and [Grails 7.0.0-M3 Release Blog Post](/blog/2025-03-05-grails-7-m3.html)

Apache Grails (incubating) 7.0.0-M4 is the first release for Grails under the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). This release focuses first on meeting the requirements of the ASF & improving the developer experience of Grails itself & Grails Applications. As part of this transition, the developers moved to a mono repository, reworked the way the various Grails CLIs work, modernized its build system, modernized the various Grails Gradle Tasks, modernized the various Grails Gradle Plugins, worked towards reproducible builds, added license headers to our source code, and changed the maven coordinates of all Grails Artifacts.

* The Grails Gradle plugin had a bug that caused plugin resolution issues that was fixed after the last milestone.
* Rework the grails bom to generate valid Gradle modules, be easier to maintain, and valid pom files.  Enhance the documentation process to parse the bom & generate the published versions in the grails doc.

And in addition to all of this:

* We changed all coordinates of Grails to be org.apache.grails based. See https://github.com/apache/grails-core/blob/7.0.x/RENAME.md for how we mapped these libraries. There is also a script documented in the upgrade guide to assist in upgrading.
* Consolidated main Grails projects into grails-core git monorepository to drastically speed up development, testing and the release process
* Significant test fixes
* Significant documentation updates & changes
* Addition of license headers to Grails Source
* Addition of NOTICE to Grails Source
* Created https://repo.grails.org/grails/restricted/ to replace https://repo.grails.org/grails/core longer term.  This virtual repo's scope is significantly reduced to help reduce the chance of using outdated libraries.

Upgrade instructions are available in the [documentation](https://docs.grails.org/7.0.0-M4/guide/single.html#upgrading60x). 

## Dependency Upgrades
In this release, we've upgraded several dependency versions, including but not limited to the following:

* Asset Pipeline 5.0.9
* Groovy 4.0.27
* Spring Framework 6.2.7
* Spring Boot 3.5.0
* Gradle 8.14
* Spock 2.3-groovy-4.0
* See all in the [grails-bom](https://docs.grails.org/7.0.0-M4/ref/Versions/Grails%20BOM.html).

## Installing Grails 7.0.0-M4
Try out Grails 7.0.0-M4 today by visiting the online app creator * [Grails Forge](https://start.grails.org/).
Alternatively, you can quickly install Grails 7.0.0-M4 using the [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/).

1. If you don't have SDKMan installed, follow the instructions at [SDKMan Installation Guide](https://sdkman.io/install/)
   to set it up.
2. Once SDKMan is installed, open your terminal and run the following command to install Grails 7.0.0-M4:

    ```shell
    sdk install grails 7.0.0-M4
    ```

3. You're all set! To verify the installation, run:

    ```shell
    grails --version
    ```

## Upgrading Your Existing Applications to Grails 7.0.0-M4
If you already have a Grails application and want to upgrade to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (preferably JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Update your application's `gradle.properties` file to specify Grails 7.0.0-M4 as the desired version.

    ```properties
    grailsVersion=7.0.0-M4
    # The Grails Gradle Plugin version is now available in the BOM
    # and can be omitted if your project adds the Grails BOM to the
    # buildscript dependencies.
    grailsGradlePluginVersion=7.0.0-M4
    # Temporary for 7.0.0-M4 to force the latest version
    groovy.version=4.0.27
    ```

3. Make any necessary adjustments to your application code, configuration, and dependencies to ensure compatibility with
   the new version. See https://docs.grails.org/7.0.0-M4/guide/single.html#upgrading60x.

Normally, Grails Core dependencies are automatically updated using the Grails Bill of Materials (BOM). However, if you
have specific versions defined in your build configuration, you may need to manually update them to align with
Grails 7.0.0-M4.

By following these steps, you should be able to transition your existing Grails application to Grails 7.0.0-M4.

### Exploring Alternative Approaches
If manual dependency updates seem daunting, or you want a more streamlined approach, consider the following alternatives:

#### 1. Use Grails Forge Website
Visit [Grails Forge](https://start.grails.org) and generate a new Grails application with Grails 7.0.0-M4. Compare the
versions in the newly generated application with your existing one to identify any discrepancies. This can serve as a
reference point for your update.

#### 2. Automated Dependency Update Bots
Configure automated dependency update bots like [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) or
[Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) with your source control platform (e.g., GitHub). These bots can automatically
detect and update outdated dependencies in your project, including Grails dependencies, saving you time and effort in
manual updates.

With these steps and alternative approaches, you should be well on your way to enjoying the exciting features and
improvements in Grails 7.0.0-M4. Happy coding!
