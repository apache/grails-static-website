Just in time for [Gr8Conf US](https://gr8conf.us/), the [Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> team](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team) at [Object Computing, Inc.](https://objectcomputing.com/) (OCI) is pleased to announce the release of [Grails 3.3 GA](https://grails.apache.org/docs/3.3.x/).

Grails 3.3 includes a number of significant improvements, most notably to GORM with GORM 6.1, which we [released earlier](/blog/2017-03-27.html) in order to gather feedback from Grails 3.2.x users.

GORM 6.1 includes some real breakthrough innovations, including [Data Services](https://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#dataServices) that allow you to define interfaces that are automatically implemented and work seamlessly with GORM's multi-tenancy features.

Other highlights of Grails 3.3 include the new [EventBus](https://async.grails.org/latest/guide/index.html#events) abstraction which integrates with existing reactive libraries such as RxJava. Events are also for the first time transaction aware so that consumers are only notified if the surrounding transaction is successful, which simplifies code greatly.

Overall there is an abundance of new features and improvements that developers will be able to take advantage of, from the [new testing framework](https://testing.grails.org/) to improvemments to [JSON Views](https://views.grails.org/latest/).

All of these new features and more are covered in the [What's New guide](https://grails.apache.org/docs/3.3.x/guide/introduction.html#whatsNew). Thanks to the Grails community who contributed greatly to making the release a success and we look forward [to your feedback](https://github.com/apache/grails-core/issues)!
