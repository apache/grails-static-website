The Grails Foundation would like to follow up on the 
[Open Letter To Our 
Community](https://objectcomputing.com/resources/news/2024/05/10/open-letter-our-open-source-communities) that was recently published by Object Computing, Inc. (OCI).  
We have assembled a Grails Community Steering Committee with the goal of 
helping define the path forward for the Grails framework. One of the first 
priorities of the group is to define the scope for a meaningful and valuable 
Grails 7, which can be created and supported responsibly. Achieving that will 
require contributions from a combination of passionate community members and 
organizations who care about being involved in the future of the technology.

Our experience has shown that increased transparency regarding challenges and 
opportunities is crucial for the Framework's continued development. We're 
committed to improving communication in this area.

The Grails Steering Committee’s current focus is on three key goals:

1. Defining an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for Grails 7.
2. Outlining Community Contribution Opportunities: We'll clearly define how individuals and organizations can contribute to the MVP's development.
3. Highlighting Contribution Methods: We recognize that contributions come in various forms. Some organizations may prefer dedicating engineering resources, while others might choose to provide financial support for a core development team.

Previously, these contribution avenues have existed but lacked clear 
communication. We're committed to making them more visible and accessible.

The work we are doing right now will enable our community to have a greater 
impact on the future of the Grails framework. The feedback we get in the coming 
weeks will be enlightening. We must understand what is important from the 
community’s perspective, and for us to envision the possible paths to accomplish 
desired outcomes. OCI is committed to stewarding the framework forward including 
helping the technology and the community find a public place for the community to 
rally around the technology.

Creating and maintaining these free and open solutions is a significant commitment 
and it will take a positively energized community to help us carry things forward. 
Every single message we have received and every single conversation we have been 
involved in in recent weeks has been helpful, appreciated, and respectful. This 
community is remarkable and your input is sincerely appreciated.

We will continue to communicate more information here in the coming weeks. Always 
feel welcome to reach out to us at [info@grails.org](mailto:info@grails.org) if you have any questions, 
concerns, or would like to engage in ways that you are currently not.  Together 
we are all defining the way forward and your help is appreciated.
