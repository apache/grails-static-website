After several release candidates and great feedback from the community, the [Grails<sup>&reg;</sup> team](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team "Grails Team") at Object Computing, Inc. (OCI) is pleased to announce the GA availability of [Grails 4](https://github.com/apache/grails-core/releases/tag/v4.0.0).

Grails 4 represents a significant upgrade, with the framework now rebased on top of an updated minimum set of dependencies including:

*   Spring 5.1
*   Spring Boot 2.1
*   Java 8
*   Hibernate 5.4
*   Groovy 2.5
*   Gradle 5

In addition, [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/ "Micronaut") is now included as part of the Grails framework as the parent ApplicationContext, allowing any Micronaut feature, whether it be the declarative HTTP client or the Kafka client, to be used within a Grails 4 application. In fact the [Micronaut HTTP client](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#httpClient) is now considered the supported HTTP client for use within Grails applications.

Startup time and memory consumption have also been optimized and improved significantly over previous releases, thanks to changes in both Spring Boot 2.1 and also the migration of some of the Grails framework's internal infrastructure wiring to Micronaut.

Many Grails plugins have been verified as working with Grails 4\. For those within the Grails plugin community, now is the time to upgrade your plugins and verify they continue to work with Grails 4. As this is a new major version, [API changes have been made](https://grails.apache.org/docs/4.0.x/guide/upgrading.html), as well as changes within Spring Boot, Groovy, and Hibernate that may require changes to work with Grails 4\. Please read the [upgrade documentation](https://grails.apache.org/docs/4.0.x/guide/upgrading.html) for more information.

Thanks to all those who contributed to the release, and if you haven't already, do sign up for [next week's webinar](https://objectcomputing.com/products/micronaut/community/something-big-is-coming) where we have more exciting announcements related to the Grails framework and Micronaut planned.
