The Grails Foundation is recognizing and celebrating great leadership and
stewardship from [James Fredley](https://github.com/jamesfredley).

## Thank You James Fredley!

The Grails Foundation and Object Computing have been supporting the Grails
community, with a special focus on Grails 6.2.x and the upcoming Grails 7
release expected in Q1 2025. This new release will streamline many aspects of
the framework, update dependencies, and introduce exciting new capabilities. The
team’s dedication has been exceptional, and the community is deeply appreciative
of their efforts.

As with projects at the Apache Foundation, Grails doesn’t have a formal project
or technical lead. Instead, leadership naturally emerges from those who
contribute. James Fredley is one such individual who has been instrumental in
driving the team forward on Grails 7. His technical expertise on the complex
codebase has been invaluable, but perhaps even more remarkable is his role as a
caring and supportive steward of the technology.

James is a sharp technologist who excels in guiding technical discussions, even
when opinions clash. His ability to lead these conversations to a productive
outcome, regardless of where the team initially stands, demonstrates not only
his technical skill but also his exceptional leadership and character. He is a
true asset to the team and the community.
James’ contributions go far beyond code; his leadership and personal dedication
to the Grails project have been key toward making Grails 7 a reality. I do not
believe that Grails 7 would be in the great position that it is in right now if
it were not for the dedication and commitment that James has invested.  It is
with great appreciation that we recognize James as a [Grails Community Rock Star](/community.html).
Please join us in thanking James Fredley for everything he has done to elevate
Grails to new heights. His efforts are deeply valued. James, you truly are a
Grails leader and a great person. Please keep up the fantastic work!

Thank you, James!
