As a follow-up to our [blog post](/blog/2024-06-07-grails-future.html) a few months ago, we have worked with the community to assemble a Grails Community Steering Committee and enabled [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/grails/discussions) in the grails GitHub org to solicit feedback on a number of topics.
The goal of this was to help design a path forward for the Grails framework. One of the first priorities was to define
the scope for a meaningful and valuable Grails 7. This effort required significant contributions from a combination of
passionate community members and organizations who care about being involved in the future of the technology. We are
pleased with the progress the Steering Committee has made so far as efforts continue to be made towards the Grails
framework 7 MVP.

When the committee was initially put together, we did not reach out to individuals, but instead let members of the
community volunteer their time and efforts as they felt they could help. We want to continue to create awareness and
encourage community participation. Please join us [here](https://slack.grails.org/) in our Grails Community Slack to get involved. Additionally,
there is a 60-minute online meeting each Thursday at 10:00am US Central during which the team will be discussing
priorities for the technology and helping to manage governance of the Framework.

We want to thank you in advance for your continued support of the Grails framework and our amazing community.
